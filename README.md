## Project Purpose
Websites' ability to print display back to the user:
* The user details
* The selected items
* A site generated string (date or any string as an example)

## set up
The site can be accessed [here](https://vinge1718.github.io/asssignment/)

## Known Problems
- It will not add the numeric value of the items selected but will only display their strings
- Unless the page is refreshed, you can't undo the list already populated in the "my items" in the check out area
